# Hands-on Session Report — Technology Information System (30 October)

Author: Logapriyah  
Date: 30 October  
Course: Technology Information System

## Summary
This hands-on session, part of our Technology Information System course, took place on 30th October. In groups we assembled a CPU and explored the actual hardware components and how they connect inside a system unit. The activity was a fun, meaningful learning experience that reinforced practical understanding beyond classroom theory.

## Purpose
- To gain practical, hands-on experience assembling computer hardware.
- To understand the role and placement of each component inside a system unit.
- To improve teamwork and collaborative troubleshooting skills.

## Highlights
- Group-based assembly of a CPU and system unit components.
- Identification and connection of hardware parts (motherboard, CPU, RAM, storage, power supply, etc.).
- Peer discussion, mutual assistance, and collaborative learning that made the session engaging and effective.

## Key Topics Observed
- Hardware components and their functions
- Physical connections and form-factor awareness (e.g., mounting, cabling)
- Basic safety and best practices for handling components (ESD awareness, correct seating)
- Team communication during assembly and testing

## What I Learned
- How individual hardware parts fit together to form a functioning system.
- Practical steps for assembling and testing a system unit.
- The value of hands-on practice for reinforcing theoretical knowledge.
- How teamwork speeds up problem solving and helps clarify concepts through peer explanation.

## Takeaways
- Hands-on labs are essential for building confidence with hardware.
- Seeing and handling components makes abstract concepts (from lectures) much clearer.
- Collaboration is valuable — discussing decisions and troubleshooting together improves learning outcomes.

## Next Steps (Personal)
- Practice assembling/disassembling more systems to build speed and confidence.
- Document each component's specifications and typical compatibility considerations.
- Try troubleshooting exercises (e.g., diagnosing POST issues or boot failures).
- Look for hardware-focused labs, tutorials, or small projects to reinforce skills.
